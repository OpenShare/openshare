# OpenShare

OpenShare provides straightforward, declarative, and completely customizable API wrappers for sharing and counting on major social networks and platforms. Zero styling, maximum flexibility. But, unlike other social sharing tools, we don't retarget and profit from your users. Your data is your data â€” this is OpenShare.

[Check out the examples](http://openshare.social/examples) to see OpenShare in action or [dive right into the documentation](https://github.com/dsurgeons/OpenShare/wiki).
